                                    TNC  FIRMWARE

                                    (version 2.1)

                      Copyright 1987, Ronald E. Raikes (WA8DED)

               This firmware supports the full AX.25  link-layer  protocol,
          version 2.0 as described in the ARRL specification dated  October
          1984,  as  well  as   the   pre-existing   version   1.x.    This
          implementation supports multiple  simultaneous  link  connections
          with either version protocol.  This release has been compiled for
          a maximum of four connections, although any reasonable number  of
          connections is possible by changing  one  MAXLNK  symbol  in  the
          source header file.  The  firmware  is  contained  in  one  26256
          EPROM, and is intended to  be  installed  in  a  TAPR  TNC-2  (or
          equivalent, such as the MFJ-1270 or AEA  PK-80)  in  socket  U23.
          RAM memory is automatically sized, supporting both  16k  and  32k
          configurations.

               Commands and information are sent to the tnc in the form  of
          lines.  Lines may be up to 256  characters  long,  including  the
          terminating CARRIAGE RETURN.  If the 256th character  entered  is
          not a CARRIAGE RETURN, it will be discarded and a BELL  character
          will be output to the terminal.  BACKSPACE and DELETE may be used
          to remove single characters from the line.  The entire  line  may
          be permanently backspaced out by entering a CONTROL-U or CONTROL-
          X.  A CONTROL-R will temporarily backspace out any  partial  line
          to allow incoming frames to be  displayed.   A  second  CONTROL-R
          will then restore  the  line  to  allow  continuation  of  entry.
          During the time a partial line is saved, only  another  CONTROL-R
          will be  accepted  from  the  keyboard  (with  the  exception  of
          xon/xoff, of course).  BELL characters are echoed to the terminal
          when entered or  removed.   Lines  which  begin  with  an  ESCAPE
          character (echoed as '* ') are interpreted  as  commands.   If  a
          command is issued with no parameter, the current  value  of  that
          commands parameter is displayed.  Lines without a leading  ESCAPE
          character are sent as information.

               The firmware provides the operator  with  five  virtual  tnc
          channels, numbered 0 to 4.  The terminal is logically attached to
          only one of these  channels  at  a  time,  selected  by  the  'S'
          command.  Information sent on channel 0 is always  unproto.   The
          unproto path may be set by issuing a 'C' command when  channel  0
          is selected.  Channels 1 - 4 are also unproto  if  they  are  not
          currently connected.  Outgoing connect requests may be issued  on
          any unconnected channel, while incoming connect requests will use
          the first available  channel  (provided  the  maximum  number  of
          connections set  by  the  'Y'  command  will  not  be  exceeded).
          Information received on a connected channel that is not currently
          selected will remain queued there until that channel is selected.
          The STA led indicates there is queued information,  and  the  'L'
          command may be used to  determine  the  channel(s)  where  it  is
          located.  Information  for  transmission  is  sent  only  to  the
          currently selected channel.  When a connection is ended, received
          information will remain queued until it has been displayed.  If a
          new digipeater path  is  desired  while  a  connection  is  being
          established or is in progress, it is not necessary to  disconnect
          first.  Simply re-issuing the 'C' command will  re-establish  the
          connection via the new path without any loss of information.

               Which protocol version is used to initiate a  connection  is
          controlled by the 'V' command, but the version  will  be  changed
          automatically, if necessary, to conform to the version of the tnc
          responding.  Version 2 protocol is more  effecient  in  terms  of
          network  throughput  and   loading,   especially   under   severe
          conditions.  Version 2 protocol is the default and should be used
          whenever possible.  When version 2 protocol is used, a  watch-dog
          timer is started whenever information is not  being  transmitted.
          If the tnc remains idle for three minutes, it will poll the other
          tnc to determine  if  the  link  is  still  established.   If  no
          response is received after the number of tries  set  by  the  'N'
          command, a link failure is reported.  This  procedure  will  also
          detect the case where someone connects and  then  leaves  without
          disconnecting.  Changing the protocol version during a connection
          is not permitted.

               The 'F', 'I', 'N', 'O', and 'V' commands maintain individual
          parameters for each channel.  The value stored in  channel  0  is
          used to initialize channels 1 - 4  upon  power  up,  and  to  re-
          initialize channels 1 - 4 after a disconnect.   This  allows  the
          values to be changed independently on each channel, prior to  and
          during a connection, and then automatically revert  back  to  the
          standard values when the connection  is  ended.   A  'D'  command
          issued on a disconnected channel 1 - 4  will  also  re-initialize
          that channel.

               Frame monitoring is controlled  by  the  'M'  command.   The
          command parameter determines the types of frames  monitored,  and
          is a list of desired  frames  chosen  from  the  letters  in  the
          following table:

               LTR       FRAME
               ---       -----
                N        None
                I        I frames
                U        UI frames
                S        Supervisory frames
                C        Monitor while connected
                +        Call signs to be included (maximum of 8)
                -        Call signs to be excluded (maximum of 8)

          The '+' and '-' parameters may not be used together.   If  either
          is used, it must be the last parameter (followed by one to  eight
          callsigns, if applicable).  If no list of callsigns is  specified
          to be included or excluded, all callsigns will be candidates  for
          monitoring.  Entering a '+' or '-' with no callsigns  will  empty
          the list.

          An asterisk displayed after a callsign  in  the  digipeater  list
          indicates the frame was transmitted by that station.  The control
          field displayed will be one of the following:

               NAME   DESCRIPTION
               ----   -----------
               RRa  - Receive Ready
               RNRa - Receive Not Ready
               REJa - Reject
               UI   - Unnumbered Information
               DM   - Disconnected Mode
               SABM - Connect Request
               DISC - Disconnect Request
               UA   - Unnumbered Acknowledge
               FRMR - Frame Reject
               Iab  - Information
               ?ccH - Unknown

               a  = Next expected frame number (0 - 7)
               b  = Frame number of this frame (0 - 7)
               cc = Hexadecimal value

          In addition, one of the following characters will  be  displayed,
          reflecting the protocol version, command/response bits,  and  the
          poll/final bit:

           (blank) = version 1 frame without poll/final bit
                 ! = version 1 frame with poll/final bit
                 ^ = version 2 command frame without poll bit
                 + = version 2 command frame with poll bit
                 - = version 2 response frame with final bit
                 v = version 2 response frame without final bit

          The protocol identifier field is displayed in hexadecimal

               An unattended mode, controlled by the 'U' command,  provides
          for sending user supplied text to a connecting station, and  then
          allows that station to leave a  brief  message.   This  mode  can
          operate on all channels simultaneously, but in no way limits  the
          operators ability to interact with one of the connected  channels
          or  the  ability  to  make  outgoing  connect   requests.    When
          unattended mode is enabled, link status messages  are  queued  to
          the associated channel and not output to the terminal unless that
          channel  is  currently  selected.   Link  status  messages   will
          therefore  be  displayed  in   chronological   order   with   the
          information from that channel.  In addition, text supplied by the
          user with the 'U' command  will  be  sent  to  any  station  that
          connects.  If channel 0  is  left  selected,  stations  may  then
          connect and leave messages on channels 1 - 4 (limited by the  'Y'
          parameter, of course).  The 'L' command may be used to  determine
          if messages have been left on any channel.  Selecting  a  channel
          containing messages will cause all link  status  and  information
          from that channel to be displayed.  If  xon/xoff  handshaking  is
          enabled, CONTROL-S and CONTROL-Q may  be  used  to  regulate  the
          output to the terminal to allow comfortable reading.

                                 COMMAND DESCRIPTION
                                 ===================



               The 'A' command is used to enable or disable  the  automatic
          insertion of LINEFEED characters after CARRIAGE RETURN characters
          to the terminal.

               The 'C' command is used to initiate a link connection.  Note
          that 'v' or 'via' is not required (but is  allowed)  between  the
          destination callsign and the digipeater callsigns.  A 'C' command
          may be  issued  on  a  channel  already  in  use  to  change  the
          digipeater callsigns, but not the destination  callsign.   A  'C'
          command issued when channel 0 is selected sets the unproto path.

               The 'D' command is used to initiate  a  link  disconnection.
          If there is unsent or unacknowledged information  remaining,  the
          disconnect request frame will not be sent until  all  information
          has been transmitted and acknowledged.  No additional information
          will be received after the 'D' command has been issued.  A second
          'D' command may be entered  to  force  the  transmission  of  the
          disconnect request frame before all information has been sent and
          acknowledged.  A 'D' command issued during the establishment of a
          link or after a disconnect request  frame  has  been  transmitted
          will cause an immediate return to the disconnected state.  A  'D'
          command issued on a disconnected channel will  re-initialize  the
          connection dependent parameters to the values stored  in  channel
          0.

               The 'E' command is used to enable or disable the echoing  of
          input (commands and information) to the terminal.

               The 'F' command is used to  set  the  frame  acknowledgement
          interval.  This interval is used to compute the timeout  interval
          before a packet is retransmitted, using the formula:

               time (seconds) = frame ack * (2 * number of digipeaters + 1)

          A separate frame acknowlegement interval value is maintained  for
          each connection channel.  The value stored in channel 0  is  used
          to  initialize  each  connection  channel  upon   power   up   or
          disconnection.

               The 'G' command is used to interrogate virtual tnc  channels
          when host mode is enabled.  If no  parameter  is  specified,  the
          next chronological item (information  or  link  status)  will  be
          returned, provided there is one.   This  command  is  invalid  in
          terminal  mode.   A  later  section  is  devoted  to  host   mode
          operation.

               The 'I' command is used to set the tnc source callsign.  The
          initial value is all blanks.  Changing the  tnc  source  callsign
          while connected is not permitted.  If the tnc source callsign  is
          left blank, the tnc will not allow connect  commands  or  unproto
          transmissions.  The callsign stored  in  channel  0  is  used  to
          initialize   each   connection   channel   upon   power   up   or
          disconnection.

               The 'JHOST' command is used to select between  terminal  and
          host modes.  A later section is devoted to host mode operation.

               The 'L' command is used to display the link status of one or
          all channels.   Information  displayed  includes  the  connection
          path, number of receive frames not yet displayed, number of  send
          frames not yet transmitted, number of transmitted frames not  yet
          acknowledged, and the  current  retry  count.   A  '+'  character
          preceeding the channel number indicates  the  currently  selected
          channel.  Operation of this command when host mode is enabled  is
          somewhat different, and is described in a later section.

               The 'M' command is used to set the  frame  monitoring  mode.
          The command parameter determines the types of  frames  monitored,
          and is a list of desired frames chosen from the  letters  in  the
          following table:

               LTR       FRAME
               ---       -----
                N        None
                I        I frames
                U        UI frames
                S        Supervisory frames
                C        Monitor while connected
                +        Call signs to be included (maximum of 8)
                -        Call signs to be excluded (maximum of 8)

          The '+' and '-' parameters may not be used together.   If  either
          is used, it must be the last parameter (followed by one to  eight
          callsigns, if applicable).  If no list of callsigns is  specified
          to be included or excluded, all callsigns will be candidates  for
          monitoring.  Entering a '+' or '-' with no callsigns  will  empty
          the list.

               The 'N' command is used to set the maximum number of times a
          frame  will  be  transmitted  without  receiving  an  appropriate
          acknowledgement, before a link failure is  assumed.   A  separate
          maximum number of tries value is maintained for  each  connection
          channel.  The value stored in channel 0  is  used  to  initialize
          each connection channel upon power up or disconnection.

               The 'O' command  is  used  to  set  the  maximum  number  of
          unacknowledged I frames that may be outstanding at any one  time.
          A separate maximum number of unacknowledged  I  frames  value  is
          maintained for each connection  channel.   The  value  stored  in
          channel 0 is used to  initialize  each  connection  channel  upon
          power up or disconnection.

               The 'P' command is used to set the p-persistence value.   P-
          persistence is used  during  simplex  operation  as  a  means  of
          channel  arbitration.   Whenever   there   are   frames   to   be
          transmitted, the tnc first waits for a clear channel.   Once  the
          channel is clear, a random number between 0 and 255 is generated.
          If the random number is less than or equal to  the  p-persistence
          value,  the  PTT  line  is  asserted  and  transmission   begins.
          Otherwise, the tnc delays for the slot time interval set  by  the
          'W' command and the entire process is repeated.

               The  'QRES'  command  is  used  to  restart  the   firmware,
          including re-initialization  of  battery-backed  RAM  to  default
          parameters.

               The 'R' command is used to enable or disable the digipeating
          of frames.

               The 'S' command  is  used  to  select  the  current  channel
          number.

               The 'T' command is used to set the transmitter  keyup  delay
          interval.  The parameter is specified in 10ms increments.

               The 'U' command is used  to  enable  or  disable  unattended
          modes.

               The 'V' command is used to select whether  version  1  or  2
          protocol will be used to initiate a link connection.  A  separate
          protocol version value is maintained for each connection channel.
          The value  stored  in  channel  0  is  used  to  initialize  each
          connection channel upon power up or disconnection.  Interrogating
          this parameter during a  connection  will  reflect  the  protocol
          version currently being  used  on  that  channel.   Changing  the
          protocol version during a connection is not permitted.

               The 'W' command is used to set the p-persistence  slot  time
          interval.  P-persistence is used during simplex  operation  as  a
          means of channel arbitration.  Whenever there are  frames  to  be
          transmitted, the tnc first waits for a clear channel.   Once  the
          channel is clear, a random number between 0 and 255 is generated.
          If the random number is less than or equal to  the  p-persistence
          value set by the 'P'  command,  the  PTT  line  is  asserted  and
          transmission begins.  Otherwise, the tnc delays for the slot time
          interval and the entire process is repeated.   The  parameter  is
          specified in 10ms increments.

               The 'X' command is used to enable or disable the transmitter
          PTT line.

               The 'Y' command  is  used  to  set  the  maximum  number  of
          connections that may  established  by  incoming  requests.   This
          command has no  effect  on  the  operators  ability  to  initiate
          outgoing connection requests.

               The 'Z' command is used to enable or  disable  flow  control
          and xon/xoff handshaking to the terminal.   If  flow  control  is
          enabled, output to the terminal will be inhibited while  entering
          commands or information.  If flow control is disabled, output  to
          the terminal will not be restricted.  Flow control  and  xon/xoff
          handshaking should be disabled during periods in which the tnc is
          operated without a terminal, to  avoid  suspending  output  which
          will consume buffers.  If xon/xoff handshaking  is  enabled,  crt
          scrolling may be stopped and started using CONTROL-S and CONTROL-
          Q characters.  Flow control  and  xon/xoff  handshaking  are  not
          performed when host mode is enabled.

               The '@'  command  is  a  software  maintenance  command.   A
          parameter of 'B' will display the number of  free  buffers.   The
          'D' parameter is used to enable or disable full duplex  operation
          of the HDLC port.  A parameter of 'S' will  display  the  current
          link state.  The 'T2' parameter is  used  to  set  the  timer  T2
          interval, just as the 'T3' parameter is used to set the timer  T3
          interval.  The timer intervals are specified in 10ms  increments.
          Timer T2 controls  the  amount  of  delay  between  the  time  an
          information frame is received and the time the resulting response
          frame  is  sent.   This  delay  allows  multiple  frames  to   be
          acknowledged with a single response.  Timer T3 is  used  maintain
          link integrity.  If there is no activity during the T3  interval,
          the tnc  will  poll  to  verify  the  distant  station  is  still
          connected.  The 'V'  parameter  is  used  to  enable  or  disable
          callsign validation.



                                 HOST MODE OPERATION
                                 ===================

               Host mode is intended to provide a user  interface  suitable
          for operation under control of a host  processor.   Commands  and
          information to the tnc, as well as status  and  information  from
          the tnc, are clearly identified to allow orderly and  unambiguous
          communication.  To alleviate any need for  hardware  or  software
          handshaking,  the  tnc  will  not  send  to  the  host  processor
          unsolicited,  and  all  exchanges  are  limited  to  256   bytes.
          Information transfers are fully transparent.

               When host mode is enabled, the first byte sent  to  the  tnc
          must be a channel number.  If  information  is  being  sent,  the
          second byte must be a binary 0.  If a command is being sent,  the
          second byte must be a binary 1.   The  third  byte  must  be  the
          binary length of the actual information or  command,  decremented
          by 1 (vacuous information or commands are  not  permitted).   The
          actual  information  or   command   bytes   must   follow   last.
          Information sent to channel 0 will be sent unproto.   Information
          sent to an unconnected channel 1 - 4 will be discarded.  The  tnc
          will respond to both information  and  commands  with  a  channel
          number first, followed by a binary code of 0, 1, or 2, signalling
          success or failure.  Codes of 1 or 2 will be followed by  a  null
          terminated message.  Channels may be  interrogated  for  incoming
          information or link status by using  the  'G'  command.   Monitor
          headers and monitor information will always be sent to channel 0,
          along with connect request link status messages.  All other  link
          status messages will be sent to the  appropriate  channel,  along
          with that channels connected information.  In response to  a  'G'
          command, the tnc  will  respond  with  a  channel  number  first,
          followed by a binary code of 0 if  nothing  is  available,  or  a
          binary code of 3 - 7, identifying the bytes that follow.  A  code
          of  4  indicates  the  monitored  frame  does  not   contain   an
          information field.  A code of 5  indicates  the  monitored  frame
          does contain an information field, and the next  'G'  command  on
          channel 0 will return that information field, preceeded by a code
          of 6.

                                 ==================

               In some instances, it  may  be  desirable  to  have  default
          parameters which differ from the standard values.  To allow  easy
          access, all default parameters have been placed at the  beginning
          of the EPROM at location 0040H.  The  following  listing  defines
          the layout of this area:
